                <p>Academic mentors play a vital role in the success of each APR.Intern internship. They provide guidance and steer the PhD student towards the project's research goals.</p>
                 <p>When a mentor is teamed with a PhD student, the business can leverage from a bigger pool of research expertise. Through direct engagement with industry, academics can accelerate R&D income and strengthen partnerships.
                </p><p>APR.Intern also assists education institutions to build new partnerships with industry. Many academics are utilising the Program as a platform to engage with industry due to the nature of its shorter project timeframes of approximately 3-5 months. This is a reasonable timeframe for both the academic and industry partner to assess opportunities for further collaboration.</p>
