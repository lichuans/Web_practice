                <p>Even though Latin is considered a dead language (no country officially speaks it), its influence upon other languages makes it still important. Latin words and expressions are present in virtually all the languages around the world, as well as on different scientific and academic fields.
                </p>
                <p>Latin is from the Italic branch of languages, along with Oscan and a few more long-dead languages. Greek is from the Greek/Hellenic branch of languages. Both branches are part of the larger Indo-European language family, along with the Germanic branch (English etc.), the Slavic branch (Russian etc.), and several other branches.

                <p>While it is true that Latin was influenced by Greek in ways other than vocabulary such as grammar, most similarities between Greek words and Latin words you observe are probably due to their common ancestor, the hypothetical Proto-Indo-European language, the ancestor of the Indo-European family of languages. All Indo-European languages retain much of their Proto-Indo-European inheritance.
                </p><p>It is also true that some Indo-European branches are more closely related than others; but I believe the Italic branch was more closely related to the Celtic branch than to the Greek branch. It may be that Italic and Greek are more closely related than Germanic and Slavic, however. Even though Latin is considered a dead language (no country officially speaks it), its influence upon other languages makes it still important. Latin words and expressions are present in virtually all the languages around the world, as well as on different scientific and academic fields.
